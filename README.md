## Introduction
<p align="justify">
With cloud computing, the world is literally at our fingertips! The emergence of cloud computing can elevate the competitiveness
of businesses despite its potential to reduce the computing cost, accelerate the business operations,and optimize time to market
(Abolfazli, Sanaei, Tabassi, Rosen, Gani, &Khan, 2015). The power of cloud computing for small business can be seen from the the COVID-19 pandemic period. SMEs that operated in the cloud were better able to pivot to remote working and new business models 
than those that relied on physical datastores and legacy infrastructure. Cloud computing provided these teams with the tools they needed to keep operating in the face of lockdown measures, and in many cases, it helped them increase productivity. Amazon is the market leader in cloud computing. Overall, the company’s service, Amazon Web Services, has a 32% market share over the competition. The other top four include Azure(20%), Google Cloud(9%), and Alibaba(6%).

Many organizations are moving to cloud based deployments from on-premise deployments due to various reasons. Top reasons for being moved into cloud deployments are;
</p>

<ol>
  <li>No major capital investment</li>
  <li>Pay as you go like plans give flexible maintenance cost options.</li>
  <li>Massively set of infrastructure build options suits to individual’s needs with lot of customization.</li>
  <li>Online training materials provide faster on boarding of the teams and staff.</li>
  <li>Organization can use their staff for more productive work by handing over the infra maintenance to the cloud providers.
</li>
</ol>

<p align="justify">
For the purpose of analyzing various cloud solutions available for small and medium businesses, we have to understand the current IT infrastructure setup of the target enterprise and recognize the possible cloud solution replacements available. To exemplify in detail, **VPK Group** has  been considered as the target enterprise. 
</p>

## Background of the Enterprise
<p align="justify">

VPK Group is a leading packaging group that was established in Belgium in 1935. Since then, it has grown from being a local player to the current international supplier of sustainable protective packaging solutions, covering 3 market segments: **corrugated board, solid board, and tubes & corner protectors**. As a packaging group, VPK strive to provide an optimal and reliable service by paying close attention to the local markets and, at the same time, share their expertise and knowledge across countries, in order to guarantee the best solutions in line with their customers’ needs. VPK Group’s continued growth is mainly the result of its long-term vision, a sound financial structure and commitment to sustainability, both ecologically and economically. VPK team believe that sustainability not only concerns our products, but also our internal and external relationships, our management approach and our planet. The whole team consists of more than 6500 committed people spread over 70 plants in 20 countries.

</p>

## Current IT Setup
<p align="justify">

VPK IT infrastucture runs on a hybrid model. They have their IT environment constructed around Windows based operating systems and the  user and resource management is controlled through Active Directory domain services. The enterprise application servers and the exchange servers are hosted on-premises. The Datacenter they rented out could not withstand anymore resource/resource upgrade requests. This led, the firm to think of adopting a cloud solution to their current problems

As the first step to the cloud environment, they decided to purchase Azure Premium subscription and opt for Microsoft 365, which is a  cloud based email solution. This helped them to architect plans to migrate the required application/service clusters to the Azure cloud. The Office 365 subscription replaced their existing Exchange infrastructure and it also helped to get newer and advanced versions of the Microsoft Office products with licenses and access to other services. However, there are many other structures which can still be considered to be migrated to cloud. Some of the key areas are described below:

**The SharePoint Service:** The collaboration system that uses workflow application is hosted on an on-premise server with limited storage capacity and computing power. The Microsoft support for Sharepoint Server 2013, which serves the purpose for VPK,  is ending soon as per the information below.
<p align="justify">

"Microsoft is ending support for certain SharePoint On-Premise versions, including SharePoint 2013. Users with an existing on-premises SharePoint 2013 intranet should make plans to migrate over to SharePoint Online before the end of life (EOL) date of April 11, 2023. By 2026, SharePoint 2019 and 2019 will also be obsolete" (https://powell-software.com/resources/blog/sharepoint-online-vs-on-premise/)

**The Order Processing software system and it's Database:**
The applications used for processing the orders are hosted on-premise on Windows 2012 server platform with low compute power, which absolutely slows down the accessibility and the orders gets delayed.
</p>

## Recommendations 
<p align="justify">

1. To overcome the end of service support to the existing infrastructure for Sharepoint On-prem 2013 version and to increase the compute and storage power, it's best to opt for the Sharepoint Online Services.
</p>

## Justifications
<p align="justify">
"The Covid-19 pandemic exposed the limitations of on-premise software. As many people were forced to work from home during the pandemic, there was a quick realization that on-premise software may not be the best option moving forward. On-premise software simply refers to software run on computers at the location of the person or organization using the software.

When compared to things like the cloud or server farms, on-premise software is greatly limited. So, the problem that organizations commonly faced at the height of the pandemic was an inability to access information remotely."(https://powell-software.com/resources/blog/sharepoint-online-vs-on-premise/)
